            <p>The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.</p>
            <p>The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.</p>
            <p>Some collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but None.</p>
            <p>Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the repr() function or the slightly different str() function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the print() function.<p>
          </div>

        <section id="truth_value_testing" class="main-section">
          <header><h4>Truth Value Testing</h4></header>
          <div>
            <p>Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.</p>
            <p>By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a __bool__() method that returns False or a __len__() method that returns zero, when called with the object. 1 Here are most of the built-in objects considered false:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                constants defined to be false: None and False.
              </li>
              <li>
                zero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0), Fraction(0, 1)
              </li>
              <li>
                empty sequences and collections: '', (), [], {}, set(), range(0)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return one of their operands.)</p>

          <div>
            <p>There are eight comparison operations in Python. They all have the same priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations).</p>
            <p>Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily; for example, x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).</p>
            <p>This summarizes the comparison operations:</p>
            <ul class="code-list">
              <li>
                <code><strong><</strong> ...strictly less than</code>

          <header><h4>Numeric Types</h4></header>
          <div>
            <p>There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers have unlimited precision. Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in sys.float_info. Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating point number. To extract these parts from a complex number z, use z.real and z.imag. (The standard library includes the additional numeric types fractions.Fraction, for rationals, and decimal.Decimal, for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.)</p>
            <p>Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary numbers) yield integers. Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an exponent sign yield floating point numbers. Appending 'j' or 'J' to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts.</p>
            <p>Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has operands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point, which is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different types behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. 2</p>
            <p>The constructors int(), float(), and complex() can be used to produce numbers of a specific type.</p>
